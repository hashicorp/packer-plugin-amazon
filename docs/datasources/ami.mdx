# Amazon AMI Data Source

Type: `amazon-ami`

The Amazon AMI data source will filter and fetch an Amazon AMI, and output all the AMI information that will
be then available to use in the [Amazon builders](/packer/plugins/builders/amazon).

-> **Note:** Data sources is a feature exclusively available to HCL2 templates.

Basic example of usage:

```hcl
data "amazon-ami" "basic-example" {
    filters = {
        virtualization-type = "hvm"
        name = "ubuntu/images/*ubuntu-xenial-16.04-amd64-server-*"
        root-device-type = "ebs"
    }
    owners = ["099720109477"]
    most_recent = true
}
```
This selects the most recent Ubuntu 16.04 HVM EBS AMI from Canonical. Note that the data source will fail unless
*exactly* one AMI is returned. In the above example, `most_recent` will cause this to succeed by selecting the newest image.

## Configuration Reference

@include 'builder/common/AmiFilterOptions-not-required.mdx'

## Output Data

@include 'datasource/ami/DatasourceOutput.mdx'

## Authentication

The authentication for Amazon Data Sources uses the same configuration options as [Amazon Builders](/packer/plugins/builders/amazon). To learn more about all of the available authentication options please see [Amazon Builders authentication](/packer/plugins/builders/amazon#authentication).

-> **Note:** The authentication session started by a data source is separate from any authentication sessions started by an Amazon builder. Users are encouraged to use `variables` for defining and sharing configuration values between datasources and builders.

Basic example of an Amazon data source authentication using `assume_role`:

```hcl
data "amazon-secretsmanager" "basic-example" {
  name = "packer_test_secret"
  key  = "packer_test_key"

  assume_role {
      role_arn     = "arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:role/ROLE_NAME"
      session_name = "SESSION_NAME"
      external_id  = "EXTERNAL_ID"
  }
}
```
