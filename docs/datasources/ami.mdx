# Amazon AMI Data Source

Type: `amazon-ami`

The Amazon AMI data source will filter and fetch an Amazon AMI, and output all the AMI information that will
be then available to use in the [Amazon builders](/docs/builders/amazon/instance.mdx).

-> **Note:** Data sources is a feature exclusively to HCL2 templates.

Basic example of usage:

```hcl
data "amazon-ami" "basic-example" {
    filters = {
        virtualization-type = "hvm"
        name = "ubuntu/images/*ubuntu-xenial-16.04-amd64-server-*"
        root-device-type = "ebs"
    }
    owners = ["099720109477"]
    most_recent = true
}
```
This selects the most recent Ubuntu 16.04 HVM EBS AMI from Canonical. Note that the data source will fail unless
*exactly* one AMI is returned. In the above example, `most_recent` will cause this to succeed by selecting the newest image.

## Configuration Reference

- `filters` (map[string]string) - Filters used to select an AMI. Any filter described in the docs for
[DescribeImages](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeImages.html)
is valid.

- `owners` ([]string) - Filters the images by their owner. You
may specify one or more AWS account IDs, "self" (which will use the
account whose credentials you are using to run Packer), or an AWS owner
alias: for example, `amazon`, `aws-marketplace`, or `microsoft`. This
option is required for security reasons.

- `most_recent` (bool) - Selects the newest created image when true.
This is most useful for selecting a daily distro build.

## Output Data

- `id` (string) - The ID of the AMI.

- `name` (string) - The name of the AMI.

- `creation_date` (string) - The date of creation of the AMI.

- `owner` (string) - The AWS account ID of the owner.

- `owner_name` (string) - The owner alias.

- `tags` (map[string]string) - The key/value combination of the tags assigned to the AMI.
