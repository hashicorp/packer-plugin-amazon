# Amazon Secrets Manager Data Source

The Secrets Manager data source provides information about a Secrets Manager secret version,
including its secret value.

-> **Note:** Data sources is a feature exclusively available to HCL2 templates.

Basic examples of usage:

```hcl
data "amazon-secretsmanager" "basic-example" {
  name = "packer_test_secret"
  key  = "packer_test_key"
  version_stage = "example"
}

# usage example of the data source output
locals {
  value         = data.amazon-secretsmanager.basic-example.value
  secret_string = data.amazon-secretsmanager.basic-example.secret_string
  version_id    = data.amazon-secretsmanager.basic-example.version_id
  secret_value  = jsondecode(data.amazon-secretsmanager.basic-example.secret_string)["packer_test_key"]
}
```

Reading key-value pairs from JSON back into a native Packer map can be accomplished
with the [jsondecode() function](/docs/templates/hcl_templates/functions/encoding/jsondecode).
