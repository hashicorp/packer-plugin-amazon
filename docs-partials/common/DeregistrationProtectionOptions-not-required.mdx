- `enabled` (bool) - Enable AMI deregistration protection.
  To allow the AMI to be deregistered, you must first disable deregistration protection.

- `with_cooldown` (bool) - When you turn on deregistration protection on an AMI, you have the option to include a 24-hour cooldown period.
  This cooldown period is the time during which deregistration protection remains in effect after you turn it off.
  During this cooldown period, the AMI can’t be deregistered.
  When the cooldown period ends, the AMI can be deregistered.
