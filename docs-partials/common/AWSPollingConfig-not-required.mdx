- `max_attempts` (int) - Specifies the maximum number of attempts the waiter will check for resource state.
  This value can also be set via the AWS_MAX_ATTEMPTS.
  If both option and environment variable are set, the max_attempts will be considered over the AWS_MAX_ATTEMPTS.
  If none is set, defaults to AWS waiter default which is 40 max_attempts.
  In aws sdk go v2, the max attempts is not set directly, but rather set via max wait time and delay seconds.
  maxWaitTime = maxAttempts * delaySeconds

- `delay_seconds` (int) - Specifies the delay in seconds between attempts to check the resource state.
  This value can also be set via the AWS_POLL_DELAY_SECONDS.
  If both option and environment variable are set, the delay_seconds will be considered over the AWS_POLL_DELAY_SECONDS.
  If none is set, defaults to AWS waiter default which is 15 seconds.
