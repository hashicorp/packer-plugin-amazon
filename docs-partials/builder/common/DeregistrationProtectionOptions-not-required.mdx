- `enabled` (bool) - Enable AMI deregistration protection.
  To allow the AMI to be deregistered, you must first disable deregistration protection.

- `with_cooldown` (bool) - When you turn on deregistration protection on an AMI, you have the option to include a 24-hour cooldown period.
  This cooldown period is the time during which deregistration protection remains in effect after you turn it off.
  During this cooldown period, the AMI canâ€™t be deregistered.
  When the cooldown period ends, the AMI can be deregistered.
