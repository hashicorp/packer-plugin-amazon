- `filters` (map[string]string) - Filters used to select an AMI. Any filter described in the docs for
  [DescribeImages](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeImages.html)
  is valid.

- `owners` ([]string) - Filters the images by their owner. You
  may specify one or more AWS account IDs, "self" (which will use the
  account whose credentials you are using to run Packer), or an AWS owner
  alias: for example, `amazon`, `aws-marketplace`, or `microsoft`. This
  option is required for security reasons.

- `most_recent` (bool) - Selects the newest created image when true.
  This is most useful for selecting a daily distro build.

- `include_deprecated` (bool) - Include deprecated AMIs in the filtered response. Defaults to false.
  If you are the AMI owner, deprecated AMIs appear in the response
  regardless of what is specified for `include_deprecated`.
