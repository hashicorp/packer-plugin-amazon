- `ami_block_device_mappings` (awscommon.BlockDevices) - Add one or more block device mappings to the AMI. These will be attached
  when booting a new instance from your AMI. To add a block device during
  the Packer build see `launch_block_device_mappings` below. Your options
  here may vary depending on the type of VM you use. See the
  [BlockDevices](#block-devices-configuration) documentation for fields.

- `launch_block_device_mappings` (BlockDevices) - Add one or more block devices before the Packer build starts. If you add
  instance store volumes or EBS volumes in addition to the root device
  volume, the created AMI will contain block device mapping information
  for those volumes. Amazon creates snapshots of the source instance's
  root volume and any other EBS volumes described here. When you launch an
  instance from this new AMI, the instance automatically launches with
  these additional volumes, and will restore them from snapshots taken
  from the source instance. See the
  [BlockDevices](#block-devices-configuration) documentation for fields.

- `run_volume_tags` (map[string]string) - Tags to apply to the volumes that are *launched* to create the AMI.
  These tags are *not* applied to the resulting AMI unless they're
  duplicated in `tags`. This is a [template
  engine](/packer/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/engine), see [Build template
  data](#build-template-data) for more information.

- `run_volume_tag` ([]{name string, value string}) - Same as [`run_volume_tags`](#run_volume_tags) but defined as a singular
  block containing a `name` and a `value` field. In HCL2 mode the
  [`dynamic_block`](https://packer.io/docs/templates/hcl_templates/expressions.html#dynamic-blocks)
  will allow you to create those programatically.

- `ami_architecture` (string) - what architecture to use when registering the final AMI; valid options
  are "arm64", "i386", "x86_64", or "x86_64_mac". Defaults to "x86_64".

- `boot_mode` (string) - The boot mode. Valid options are `legacy-bios` and `uefi`. See the documentation on
  [boot modes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ami-boot.html) for
  more information. Defaults to `legacy-bios` when `ami_architecture` is `x86_64` and
  `uefi` when `ami_architecture` is `arm64`.

- `uefi_data` (string) - Base64 representation of the non-volatile UEFI variable store. For more information
  see [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/uefi-secure-boot-optionB.html).

- `tpm_support` (string) - NitroTPM Support. Valid options are `v2.0`. See the documentation on
  [NitroTPM Support](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/enable-nitrotpm-support-on-ami.html) for
  more information. Only enabled if a valid option is provided, otherwise ignored.

- `use_create_image` (bool) - Whether to use the CreateImage or RegisterImage API when creating the AMI.
  When set to `true`, the CreateImage API is used and will create the image
  from the instance itself, and inherit properties from the instance.
  When set to `false`, the RegisterImage API is used and the image is created using
  a snapshot of the specified EBS volume, and no properties are inherited from the instance.
  Defaults to `false`.
